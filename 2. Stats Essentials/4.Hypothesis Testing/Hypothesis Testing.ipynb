    "### Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics is used to find some population parameter (mostly population mean) when you have no initial number to start with. So, you start with the sampling activity and find out the sample mean. Then, you estimate the population mean from the sample mean using the confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is used to confirm your conclusion (or hypothesis) about the population parameter (which you know from EDA or your intuition). Through hypothesis testing, you can determine whether there is enough evidence to conclude if the hypothesis about the population parameter is true or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis Testing starts with the formulation of these two hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null hypothesis (H₀): The status quo\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternate hypothesis (H₁): The challenge to the status quo\n",
    "\n",
    "Outcome will never be accepting the Null Hypothesis. It will be:\n",
    "1. Rejected the Null Hypothesis - Accepted Alternate Hypothesis\n",
    "2. Failed to reject null Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis always has the following signs:  =  OR   ≤   OR    ≥\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternate hypothesis always has the following signs:  ≠   OR  >   OR    <\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Situation 1:  Flipkart claimed that its total valuation in December 2016 was at least $14 billion. Here, the claim contains ≥ sign (i.e. the at least sign), so the null hypothesis is the original claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "Situation 2:  Flipkart claimed that its total valuation in December 2016 was greater than $14 billion. Here, the claim contains > sign (i.e. the ‘more than’ sign), so the null hypothesis is the complement of the original claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize this, you cannot decide the status quo or formulate the null hypotheses from the claim statement, you need to take care of signs in writing the null hypothesis. Null Hypothesis never contains ≠ or > or < signs. It always has to be formulated using = or ≤ or ≥ signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Making a Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "The formulation of the null and alternate hypotheses determines the type of the test and the position of the critical regions in the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can tell the type of the test and the position of the critical region on the basis of the ‘sign’ in the alternate hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "      \n",
    "\n",
    "       ≠ in H₁    →   Two-tailed test        →     Rejection region on both sides of distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "       < in H₁    →   Lower-tailed test     →     Rejection region on left side of distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "       > in H₁    →   Upper-tailed test     →     Rejection region on right side of distribution\n",
    "       \n",
    "#### Critical Value Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding with finding the Z value for critical value Zc and finally the critical values, let’s revise the steps performed in this method till now.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you define a new quantity called α, which is also known as the significance level for the test. It refers to the proportion of the sample mean lying in the critical region. For this test, α is taken as 0.05 (or 5%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you calculate the cumulative probability of UCV from the value of α, which is further used to find the z-critical value (Zc) for UCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "After formulating the hypothesis, the steps you have to follow to make a decision using the critical value method are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the value of Zċ from the given value of α (significance level). Take it a 5% if not specified in the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "    From significance level, depending upon tailed test, critical region will be on either side. Calculate the area of \n",
    "    critical region till UCV and then refer to the z-value using z-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For ex: significance level = 3% = 0.03\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Area under UCV(Z-value) = 1 - 0.015 = 0.985\n",
    "\n",
    "    Z-score = 0.985 in z table = 2.17\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the critical values (UCV and LCV) from the value of Zċ.\n",
    "    CV = μ + Zc*σ(Standard Error)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make the decision on the basis of the value of the sample mean x with respect to the critical values (UCV AND LCV).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "A manufacturer claims that the average life of its product is 36 months. An auditor selects a sample of 49 units of the product, and calculates the average life to be 34.5 months. The population standard deviation is 4 months. Test the manufacturer’s claim at 3% significance level using the critical value method.\n",
    "\n",
    "H₀:μ = 36 months and H₁: μ ≠ 36 months\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "α = 0.03\n",
    "\n",
    "Area under UCV = 1-0.015 = 0.985\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-score = 0.985\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-value = 2.17\n",
    "\n",
    "CV = μ + Zc*σ(Standard Error)"
