There is a trade-off between learning_rate and n_estimators. Reducing the learning rate will forcing the model train slower (but sometimes resulting in better performance scores). Decreasing the learning rate L makes the coefficients Î±_m smaller, which reduces the amplitude of the sample_weights at each step (As per weight formula we use at each step for updating weights).
